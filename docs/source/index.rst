Welcome to freejournal's documentation!
=======================================

`freejournal <http://freejournal.org/>`_ is a system for securely publishing documents to the public, 
releasing them to minimize risk to the publisher while making the documents difficult to censor, supress, or
alter once published.  FreeJournal is designed to replace organizations like 
`WikiLeaks <https://wikileaks.org/>`_ with a peer-to-peer, decentralized network that allows any
user to publish any content they deem useful or interesting.

FreeJournal runs on the `Bitmessage <https://bitmessage.org/>`_, `Freenet <https://freenetproject.org/>`_,
and `Bitcoin <https://bitcoin.org/>`_ networks, and its source is hosted on 
`Github <https://github.com/FreeJournal/freejournal>`_.  Please report any issues, bugs, or unclear
documentation you encounter there.
