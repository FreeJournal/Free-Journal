Inward Facing
This function retrives the document associated with the supplied SHA256 hash.
Every document has a unique documentHash that can be used to uniquely identify
and retrieve the indexing information (and subsequently) the document from 
other nodes on the BitMessage Network. 

To find the document assuming the information is not indexed locally, the 
calling node will have to query (over bitmessage) the other nodes for its 
existence. If one of the nodes has recieved the information in the past
TTL (usually 2 days), the node will broadcast the indexing information for the
document, allowing the request for indexing info to be completed. 

Once the original node has the indexing information (the path to the data itself),
the node will connect to freenode and use the supplied index to retrieve the payload.

Outward Facing
Create document is the outward facing function to add a document to the FreeJournal Network
To do this controllers, the document is first uploaded to FreeNet. Once there, the file
is associated with a freeNetAddress (like a URL) which is stored with the additional indexing 
information and is distrubted (via a broadcast on Bitmessage) to the FreeJournal network.  

signature - The private-key signed hash of the document, proving its authenticity. If 
			the decrypted(with the collections public key) data is equal to the hash of
			the payload, we know the data is assured authenticity
description -  a description of the contents of the document being uploaded
payload - The binary/text data that is to be uploaded\
title - The title of the document 
timestamp - The Bitcoin signed time stamp, assuring the document's timeliness/existence
collectionAddress - The address of the collection the document is being published to.
			This address is the BitMessage broadcast address for the collection

Create collection is the function nodes use to create new collections to publish documents to.
To do this a Bitmessage broadcast address is supplied, as well as a signature to identify the 
users that have the right to write to the collection.

signature - The private-key signed hash of the collectionAddress, proving its authenticity. 
			Note, since there is no payload for the initial createCollection, a signed hash 
			of the collectionAddress will act as the initial signature. The signature will
			have to be verified immediately upon creation 
description - description of the collection that is being createDocument
btcID - bitcoin transaction ID used to verify the collection  
keywords - a String-list of keywords associated with the collectoin used for internal indexing
collectionAddress - The  address of the collection. The address is the public broadcast address
			for the BitMessage protocol.

This function is used by FreeJournal nodes to retrieve an entire collection that is not 
on their local machine. To do this the randomNone and password are combined in order to 
regenerate a Public/Private key pair. This keypair is associated with the collection and 
the other nodes can be queried accordingly.
